## Definition of memetics
"A field of study called memetics arose in the 1990s to explore the concepts and transmission of memes in terms of an evolutionary model. All evolutionary processes depend on information being copied, varied, and selected, a process also known as variation with selective retention. The conveyor of the information being copied is known as the replicator, with the gene functioning as the replicator in biological evolution. Dawkins proposed that the same process drives cultural evolution, and he called this second replicator the "meme," citing examples such as musical tunes, catchphrases, fashions, and technologies." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics].

"An Internet meme, or meme (/miÀêm/, "MEEM"), is a cultural item (such as an idea, behavior, or style) that spreads across the Internet, primarily through social media platforms. Internet memes manifest in a variety of formats, including images, videos, GIFs, and other viral content. Internet memes derive from the original concept of "memes" as units of cultural transmission, passed from person to person" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme]. 

"A meme is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a culture and often carries symbolic meaning representing a particular phenomenon or theme. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme].
